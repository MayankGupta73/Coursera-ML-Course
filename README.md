<h2>Coursera - Machine Learninng by Stanford University</h2>

My implementation of all the excercises from Andrew Ng's Coursera course in Octave.

All the excercises are complete including a bit of the optional material and works correctly.
I really enjoyed this course and feel it opened me up to a completely new field while enforcing a strong foundation.
